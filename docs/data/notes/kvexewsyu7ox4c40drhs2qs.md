### **CD 7 Pre-Primary Canvass Conversion Program**

### Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a targeted door-to-door and phone/text banking campaign in Arizona’s 7th Congressional District (CD7) aimed at three high-value voter cohorts prior to the 2025 special election. By focusing on voters who have drifted from the Democratic Party, those with inactive registrations, and persuadable non-Democrats with strong civic profiles, we aim to recover lapsed supporters, re-engage inactive Democrats, and convert persuasion targets—maximizing turnout and margin gains in key precincts across Yuma, Santa Cruz, and Pima counties. The purpose of this program is twofold; It will allow us to keep EARN AZ program canvassers engaged through to the start of the CD7 primary campaign. It will also allow us to reach a wider base in the special election primary and will contribute to a longer strategy of building progressive power for 2026 and beyond.

Objectives

* Re-register & Re-engage 25,432 voters who were Democrats in 2020 but switched parties by 2024\.  
* Activate 28,252 registered Democrats currently flagged as inactive.  
* Persuade 4,696 non-Democrats with high vote-propensity (≥ 80\) and ideology scores (≥ 80).

Key Metrics

* Canvass contacts made  
* Registra­tion status updates \- activity status & party affiliation  
* Pledge to vote commitments

Resources & Budget

Monitoring & Evaluation

* Live data dashboard outline geographical coverage, as well as contact rates in three focus targets above  
* Daily soft tracking to account for shifts worked and lists assigned  
* Post campaign \+ pre-CD7 campaign deep dive

Conclusion  
By concentrating on these three data-driven cohorts within the most competitive rural and suburban precincts in CD7, this canvassing proposal aims to maximize Democratic turnout in the primary and recapture lost voters for the special election and future cycles. We anticipate a measurable increase in active Democratic support and overall vote share in the district.
