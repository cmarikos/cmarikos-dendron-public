<p>Discussion of RAZA Outreach Demographics
RAZA programs include partisan candidate and issue campaigns, relational organizing, political organizing, and RAZA advocates. RAZA’s partisan campaigns are by far the organization's largest scale work. Because we work in coalition with state tables, doors universes are necessarily more demographically broad than the more focused, mission aligned population work done by RAZE. In the persuasion phase, our doors campaigns seek to talk to as many people as possible, so we can then identify later who should be mobilized for the subsequent GOTV campaign. This year especially RAZA is committing to focusing partisan campaign resources on rural communities of color than in previous years and our campaign universe specifically targets individuals with the limitations of commercial and political scoring in mind.</p>
