**Project Description: Method, Goals, Activities, & Outcomes  

1. Background of the District/Special Election  

	a. In battleground states, highly competitive districts should increasingly be the  focus of electoral efforts. One of these highly competitive districts is located right  here in rural Arizona. By focusing on voter education, low propensity turnout, and  rural outreach, we can ensure that the progressive voter block in this district is  mobilized and motivated to have their voices heard this election cycle.  

	b. While there are slightly more Republicans in the district, the Arizona Independent  Redistricting Commission has labeled the district as highly competitive. The  majority of the district is located in Pima County with Cochise County having the  second highest number of voters in the district. Folks in the district are as diverse  as the district itself, with portions of densely packed urban areas, agricultural  hubs, and rural border communities. Given the poachability of the district in  conjunction with the lack of progressive leadership, the right investment will make  a long-term difference in representation of the district.  

2. Voter Education  

	a. Midterm elections are notorious for lower voter turnout as compared to  Presidential elections. To mitigate low voter turnout, our canvassing efforts will  have a major component of voter education. We will drive turnout by highlighting  the key dates, encouraging early voting, facilitating vote by mail, and helping  voters locate their nearest polling place on election day. We hope to educate  voters not only in how to vote but also why voting is so important.  

3. Low Propensity Voter Turnout  

	a. Youth - because mostly older folks will vote  

	Polling data has shown that older voters will make up the majority of the electorate in this election. Youth turnout is always essential for any effective  campaign strategy, but it is even more important during a midterm election.  Those whose first vote is during a midterm election, are more likely to be voters  for life. By educating young voters about the importance of voting, we will  empower them to make their voices heard on critical issues. This is of paramount  importance given the challenges to our democratic institutions and values.  

4. Rural Voter Outreach  

	a. Another important aspect of this project is that it will have a rural focus. We will  be the only organization conducting voter outreach and education in Pima,  Cochise, Pinal, Graham, and Greenlee Counties, these counties include crucial  progressive voter blocks that are often overlooked. We hope to conduct robust  voter outreach with multiple passes to these counties in order to include these  rural voices in the conversation. Additionally, we are insistent on hiring local  canvassers who, for better or worse, have to live with the consequences of these  elections in their communities. The inclusion of these community members is vital  to ensure accurate representation that reflects the unique issues rural voters  experience that may differ from Arizonans in a metropolitan setting. By targeting  the progressive voters we can defeat the notion that rural Arizona is a monolith of  Rural conservatism by diversifying the electorate to increase participation in light of an  administration actively working to discourage participation and dismantle our  democratic norms.  

	b. Goals, Activities, Outcomes  

	c. The specific method of outreach will be door to door canvassing. We will  be utilizing a paid canvassing team with upwards of 50 canvassers across  five counties (Pima, Cochise, Pinal, Graham, and Greenlee). The goals of  the campaign will be 100-120k doors with a contact rate of 15%. This will  allow our team to have direct conversations with 15,000-18,000 conversations. In a midterm election where turnout will likely be low, these conversations will be especially impactful. We also hope to achieve an opt-in rate of 1-2 people per shift interested in getting more involved with  the organization as a whole. This rate will yield close to 1,500 opt-ins/month. This will be substantially beneficial to the growth of the organization as we are able to follow up with these individuals to build base and involve them in volunteer opportunities, events, and provide opportunities for growth and leadership.**
