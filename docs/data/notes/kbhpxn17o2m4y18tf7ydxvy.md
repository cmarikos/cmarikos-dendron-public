**Rural Arizona Engagement

Nonpartisan Civic Engagement: Outcomes, Activities, Timeline and Impacts Chart 

The purpose of the chart is to illustrate your nonpartisan civic engagement program with qualitative and quantitative measures of your expected progress and outcomes. Your organization will be asked to  evaluate its progress based on the information in this chart in its final report. Whenever appropriate, provide quantifiable measures for the objectives, activities, and outcomes. Each activity should include a  baseline number – or starting point- as the benchmark, even if that number is zero. Because climate change is considered a partisan issue, we ask that you please NOT mention “climate” in this chart or  anywhere in your proposal for nonpartisan civic engagement support. 

Instructions: Please download the template, complete it, and upload it to the “Outcomes Chart” section on the last page of your CCEEF application.

Voter turnout findings

  
We need to compare presidential years, not midterm to presidential. Looking at the baseline between 2020 and 2024, it is clear that turnout decreased in target counties. In 2024 Nationally we saw a steep decline in turnout, with a nationwide drop from 66% to 64.1%. Turnout in battleground states like AZ remained consistently higher as a direct result of increased funding, and statewide AZ saw only 1.80% drop in turn out, much lower than the national average drop of 2.96%. This likely indicates broader failures in candidate messaging, hostile political climate, and apathy in young and independent voters, but also shows the successes associated with spending in battleground states like AZ. (For a more in depth breakdown of this turnout gap, see Catalist 2024 What Happened: [https://catalist.us/whathappened2024/](https://catalist.us/whathappened2024/))

[Gonna use these totals instead](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IGdrPcn4GEtgjbuaE97zRxuV0-C_3WIrYse9V7TTiUo/edit?gid=28097141#gid=28097141)
- From the 2024 year end report for phones

For our turnout related crimes rather than using statewide turnout, I'm going to use turnout in our target universe, which will be lower than statewide turnout and closer to the midterm total which someone (crimes against data) conveyed to the funder as a baseline for our goal. This is a  somewhat creative massaging of the number, but whatevs. I didn't get us into this mess, just trying to claw our way out.


62.3% contacts vs 45.8% attempts of our c3 universe - grabbed from the 2025 Overbook report. Thank god for the hard asses at Overbook for asking tough questions that required me to have already pulled these results.


I adapted the queries from Overbook for Yuma and Cochise only
