# Hi, I'm Christina

I design and maintain durable, well documented data systems for civic engagement teams. 

 I develop pipelines and documentation systems that connect field organizing, voter registration, development, and fundraising, to powerful data driven insights. My work combines **data engineering**, **geospatial analysis**, and **human-centered documentation** to make complex data more accessible and sustainable for civic engagement data teams.
