<p><strong>Rapid Response Manual and Training Curriculum</strong>
By March 25, 2025, a rapid response manual clearly defining every step that will go into coordinated response to any threat to the communities we serve will be created. This will include roles for not only the organizing department but for political, communications, the executive team, and other departments that may need to be activated. This manual will be executed by the relevant regional organizing team based on need throughout the year. This will ensure our organization can be as nimble as possible in the face of adversity to maximize our impact. By June 30, 2025, a training curriculum on the basics of organizing will be created as well. This will cover topics such as organizing history, 1:1s, listening sessions, deep canvassing, recruitment, base building, and action tactics. </p>
<p><strong>Build Base and Statewide Power in Rural Arizona</strong>
<em>By July 15, 2025, each organizer will have a clearly defined base of 50 fully engaged volunteers.</em> This defined base will include volunteers who consistently show up for organizational events, external events, respond to calls to action, and participate in phone banks, text banks, canvasses, etc. Of this engaged volunteer base, each organizer will identify 10 volunteer leads who can run volunteer activities on their own. <em>By December 5, 2025, each organizer will grow their base to 70 volunteers.</em> Participation will be sustained by statewide peak events, monthly listening sessions, regionally specific events, social, and community service days of action. <em>This will create the largest and most regionally diverse base of volunteers and leaders the organization has seen to date.</em></p>
<p><strong>Maintain Evergreen Programming and Tactics</strong>
<em>By April 22, 2025, regularly occurring programming will begin with a focus on the issue areas of civic engagement, environmental justice, immigration, childcare policy, and urgent regional needs.</em> <em>This will include monthly listening sessions, monthly deep canvases, phone banks for recruitment, and text banks as needed.</em> In all service counties, 2 peak events will occur in order to engage with regionally specific issues and topics of interest. Organizers will also create social and community service oriented events to serve as a springboard into broader organizing activities and action. This will allow for greater diversity, inclusion of working families, those with limited time, and provide entry level exposure for those earliest on their journey with justice work. <em>Additionally, 1:1s (10/month) will be utilized in order to introduce individuals to the organization and escalate their involvement over time.</em> Lastly, grasstops and institutional connections will be made by partnering with allied organizations such as schools, nonprofit organizations, organizations that provide resources and aid, churches and other religious organizations, healthcare organizations, and hospitals. </p>
