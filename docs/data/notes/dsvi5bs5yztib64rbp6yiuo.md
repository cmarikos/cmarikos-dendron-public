Please tell us about the demographics of your organization's target constituency.

Constituency is defined here as the *individuals who directly benefit from the work of your organization*.


Note: 
I am defining our constituency as the entire population of the counties weâ€™re active in. Partly because that data is easily accessible and clean. With the time we have to submit this using the broad, accessible data makes the most sense to me

###### Urbanicity

[Using this U of A Census analysis](https://crh.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/2023-06/2300601_Census-RuralUpdate-Brief.pdf) for our target counties, I got the total population of our target counties, then got a percentage of rural pop. I omitted Pima county since we don't do work in the city and it really skews the numbers.
- %Rural: 27%
- % Suburban:
- % Urban:  73%

###### Race/Ethnicity
- % African American or Black:
- % American Indian or Alaska Native:
- % Asian or Asian American (including Indian Subcontinent):
- % Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian: - no data/possibly split between "Other", "American Indian",  and "Asian"
- % Hispanic or Latinx:
- % White:
- % Multiracial or Other:
- % Middle Eastern or North African: - no data

###### Additional Demographics
- % Low-income: 19.27%
	- Using the [HUD income guidelines](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/home-datasets/files/HOME_IncomeLmts_State_AZ_2024.pdf) I'm selecting low income pop as those making less than 57.6k a year, which is the highest threshold for county based "low income" benefits

Subtract the pop_16_over from pop_25_over to get 16-25 (not gonna fuss that this includes 25 year olds, not worth the headache)

- % LGBTQ+: 4.5%
	- Using the statewide estimate from the [UCLA Williams Institute AZ Profile](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/visualization/lgbt-stats/?topic=LGBT&area=4#about-the-data) and assuming counties are *roughly* similar because there doesn't seem to be good county data
--- the following are bad ideas:
	- gonna use modeled scores from the voter file since any "DEI" census data has been deleted. This will not include unregistered ppl, so idk if its good
	- Statewide pop is ~4.5% so if it's way off from that I'll ask follow up questions
- % Immigrant/refugee: 36.34%
	- The [U of A MAP](https://mapazdashboard.arizona.edu/article/bucking-trend-arizonas-share-foreign-born-falls#:~:text=Santa%20Cruz%20County%20reported%20the,the%20lowest%20share%20at%201.6%25.) page links to census data which I downloaded. Turns out the downloaded data is kinda junk. It's only able to give me percentages by county. 
	- Gonna use the [AZ pop estimate from the 2020 Census](https://data.census.gov/profile/Arizona?g=040XX00US04) then convert the percentages by county to a number that I can then divide by total pop
--- getting "freaky" also a bad idea:
	- For this we gotta get freaky too and use a combo of the voterfile and the census data. Gonna grab the immigrant registrants from the voterfile, then add the noncitizen pop to that -- might look at avging the two files idk
